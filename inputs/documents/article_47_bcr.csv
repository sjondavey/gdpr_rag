1|1|False|"The GDPR expressly provides for the use of binding corporate rules (hereinafter ""BCR"") by a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity (hereinafter ""Group"") for transfers of personal data in the sense of Article 44 GDPR. "|1.1
1|2|False|"On 6 February 2018, the Article 29 Working Party (hereinafter ""WP29"") adopted a table with the elements and principles to be found in BCR in order to reflect the requirements referring to BCR (hereinafter ""WP256 rev.01""). The European Data Protection Board (hereinafter ""EDPB"") endorsed WP256 rev.01 on 25 May 2018 . These Recommendations also repeal and replace WP256 rev.01, while in substance building on it. "|1.2
1|3|False|"On 11 April 2018, the Article 29 Working Party (thereinafter ""WP29"") adopted Recommendations on the Standard Application for Approval of Controller Binding Corporate Rules for the Transfer of Personal Data (hereinafter: ""WP264""). The European Data Protection Board (hereinafter ""EDPB"") endorsed WP256 rev.01 on 25 May 2018. These Recommendations repeal and replace WP264, while in substance building on it. "|1.3

||False|    - Clarify the necessary content of BCR-C as stated in Article 47 GDPR; |1.4

[^2]: See WP29 Working Document setting forth a co-operation procedure for the approval of ""Binding Corporate Rules"" for controllers and processors under the GDPR, WP263 rev.01, adopted on 11 April 2018, endorsed by the EDPB. Available at https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/general-guidance/endorsed-wp29-guidelines en."|1.4
||False|    - Provide explanations and comments on the requirements. |1.4
1|5|False|"BCR-C are suitable for framing transfers of personal data from controllers covered by the geographical scope of the GDPR pursuant to Article 3 GDPR [^3] to other controllers or to processors within the same Group established in third countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection pursuant to Article 45 GDPR (hereinafter: ""internal controllers"" / ""internal processors"").  BCR for processors (hereinafter ""BCR-P""), on the other hand, apply to data that will be processed by members of the Group covered by the geographical scope of the GDPR, acting as processors on behalf of a controller that is not a member of the Group, and which are then transferred and processed by Group members as sub-processors in third countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection pursuant to Article 45 GDPR. Hence, the obligations set out in BCR-C apply in relation to entities within the same Group acting as controllers and to entities acting as 'internal' processors. As for this very last case, it is worth recalling that, in addition to the BCR- C, a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, binding on the processor with regard to the controller and which comprises all requirements as set out in Article 28(3) GDPR, must be signed by each controller acting as data exporter with all internal processors[^4]. Indeed, the obligations set forth in BCR-C apply to entities of the Group receiving personal data as ('internal') processors to the extent that this does not lead to a contradiction with the contract or other legal act entered into under Article 28(3) GDPR (i.e., the processors members of the Group processing on behalf of controllers members of the Group should primarily abide by this contract). 
[^3]: Please note that at least one group member in the EEA is required (see Chapter 3, Section 1.4 of these Recommendations).
[^4]: Article 28(3) GDPR requires, among others, for each controller-to-processor relationship a specification, by way of contract or other legal act, of the subject-matter, the duration, the nature and purposes of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. A generic description included in a BCR-C regarding the categories of data, data subjects etc. would not be sufficient in this regard."|1.5
1|6|False|EU data protection legislation applicable to members of the Group must be complied with and cannot be overruled by provisions in the BCR-C, unless the BCR- C voluntarily provide for a higher level of protection. |1.6
1|7|False|Pursuant to Article 46(2)(b) GDPR, BCR are appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal data to third countries. BCR create enforceable rights and set out commitments in order to create, for the personal data transferred under the BCR, a level of protection essentially equivalent to the one provided by the GDPR. Therefore, it is not sufficient for the BCR C to only make reference to provisions of the GDPR, and BCR C applicants should rather expressly formulate the requirements within their BCR-C. |1.7
1|8|False|"BCR are subject to approval[^5] by the BCR Lead. In this respect, it is worth highlighting the difference between the BCR Lead â€“ which is competent for issuing the approval of the BCR - and the SA that is competent for a specific transfer carried out by a certain controller under that BCR-C[^6]. 
[^5]: In accordance with Article 47(1) GDPR.
[^6]: Throughout these Recommendations, the term ""Competent SA(s)"" refers to the data protection SA(s) competent for the data exporter(s) of the specific transfer."|1.8
1|9|False|"The draft approval decision of the BCR Lead is subject to an opinion by the EDPB [^7]. The approval confirms that the requirements set out in Article 47 GDPR are met, and therefore, that the commitments included in the BCR will provide for appropriate safeguards in the sense of Article 46 GDPR. 
[^7]: In accordance with Article 46(4), Article 64(1)(f) and Article 64(3) GDPR."|1.9
1|10|False|"However, the approval does not include an assessment of whether each processing is in line with all requirements of the GDPR and the BCR. For instance, each data exporter needs to ensure that the requirements set out in Article 6 GDPR (Lawfulness of processing) and Article 28 GDPR (for transfers to processors) or any additional formalities specified by the national law of a Member State, if any, are met for each transfer. Furthermore, it is, for instance, the responsibility of each data exporter to assess, for each transfer, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is a need to implement supplementary measures in order to provide for a level of protection essentially equivalent to the one provided by the GDPR [^8]. Such supplementary measures are in the responsibility of the data exporter, and as such, are not assessed by supervisory authorities (hereinafter ""SAs"") as part of the process of approval of BCR. 
[^8]: See Chapter 3 of these Recommendations, Section 5.4.1, and EDPB Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data, available at https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures- supplement-transfer en."|1.10
1|11|False|"The BCR approval only covers transfers of personal data to third countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection pursuant to Article 45 GDPR. However, Groups may design BCR to be used as their global data protection policy by all entities bound (either exporters or importers) whatever their location (inside or outside the EEA). Notwithstanding this possibility, the scope of the BCR approval by the BCR Lead is always limited to transfers of personal data from entities under the scope of application of the GDPR [^9] to third countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection pursuant to Article 45 GDPR and their onward transfers to other Group members bound by the BCR (hereinafter ""BCR member(s)""). 
[^9]: Please note that at least one group member in the EEA is required (see Chapter 3, Section 1.4 of these Recommendations)."|1.11
1|12|False|Once approved, BCR can be used for transfers from all relevant Member States, and the SA competent for the data exporter will also be competent to assess the respect of the BCR by the data importer in the third country in relation to the relevant transfers.|1.12
1|13|False|These Recommendations become effective on the date of their publication. |1.13
1|14|False|"Consequently, the EDPB expects all new and ongoing BCR-C applicants to bring their BCR-C in line with the requirements set out below. BCR-C applications that by the time these recommendations are published have already reached the stage of a ""consolidated draft"" in accordance with 2.4 of WP 263 rev.01 and for which the EDPB also issues its opinion by the end of 2023 will have to bring their BCR in line with these recommendation with their 2024 annual update. "|1.14
1|15|False|All BCR-C holders must also comply with these Recommendations. Related changes will have to be done as part of their 2024 annual update. In line with Section 8.1 (Process for updating the BCR-C), such update will not generally trigger the need for a new approval since they are meant to improve the safeguards for data subjects. |1.15
1|16|False|The BCR Lead SAs will be ready to provide, where needed, additional information upon request. |1.16
2||True|APPLICATION FORM  |2
||False|General Instructions for Applicants:   |2
||False|- Only a single copy of the form need be filled out and submitted to the Supervisory Authority ('SA') you consider to be the BCR Lead in accordance with Articles 47(1) and 64 GDPR and the WP263; this form may be used in all EEA Member States. |2
||False|- In case of application for both BCR-C and BCR-P, separate forms need to be filled out for each BCR. |2
||False|- Please fill out all entries of Part I of the application form and submit the form to the SA you consider to be the BCR-C Lead. As soon as a decision on the BCR Lead has been made (see WP263), the BCR Lead will determine when it will invite you to fill out and submit Part II of the application form including its Annexes. |2
||False|- You may attach additional pages or annexes if there is insufficient space to complete your responses. |2
||False|- You may indicate any responses or materials that is in your opinion commercially sensitive and should be kept confidential but, in any case, be aware that the relevant document will be shared among the concerned SAs and the EDPB which, under Article 64 GDPR, has to issue its opinion on the approval draft decision of your BCR-C. Requests by third parties for disclosure of such information, will, however, be handled by each SA involved in accordance with national legislation. |2
||False|- The next steps of the procedure are described in WP263. |2
||False|- BCR holders notifying the update of their BCR-C in 2024 (see Par. 13 of the Introduction) only need to sign Section 4 ( Acknowledgment ) of Part I of the Application Form below. |2
||False|"- BCR holders must in the course of their annual update (see Section 8.1 below) confirm sufficient assets pursuant to Section 5 (""Assets"") of Part II of the Application Form below."|2
||False|Section 1: Structure and Contact Details of the Applicant and of the Group   |2
||False|"- If the Group has its headquarters in the EEA the form should be filled out and submitted by that EEA entity or, under certain circumstances, another EEA entity with delegated data protection responsibilities[^10].  In the latter case, the Group should provide additional justification as to why another EEA entity which is not the EEA headquarters is the applicant. 
[^10]: According to Article 47(2)(f) GDPR, there should always be an EU based member of the group established on the territory of a Member State accepting liability for any breaches of the binding corporate rules by any member concerned not established in the Union. If the headquarters of the group were somewhere else, the headquarters should delegate these responsibilities to a member based in the EU."|2
||False|- If the Group has its headquarters outside the EEA, then the Group should appoint a Group entity located inside the EEA - as the Group member with delegated data protection responsibilities. This is the entity which should then submit the application on behalf of the Group. |2
||False|- Contact details for queries: |2
||False|    - Please indicate a contact to whom queries may be addressed concerning the application. |2
||False|    - This contact does not need to be located in the EEA, although this might be advisable for practical reasons. |2
||False|    - You may indicate a function rather than a specific person.|2
||False|Section 2: Short description of data flows  |2
||False|- The applicant should also give a brief description of the scope and nature of the data flows to third countries for which approval is sought.|2
||False|Section 3: Determination of the BCR Lead  |2
||False|- In accordance with Article 64 GDPR, the BCR Lead is the authority in charge of coordinating the approval of your BCR-C, which then could be considered appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal data by Group members to third countries, without requiring any specific authorisation for the use of the BCR-C from the other SAs concerned. |2
||False|    - Before you approach one SA as the presumptive BCR Lead, you should examine the factors listed in Section 1 of WP263. Based on these factors you should explain in Part 1.3 of the Application Form which SA should be the BCR Lead. The SAs are not obligated to accept the choice that you make if they believe that another SA is more suitable to be BCR Lead, in particular if it would be worth for speeding up the procedure (e.g. taking into account the workload of the originally requested SA). |2

Part 1.4
||False|- before carrying out any transfer of personal data on the basis of the approved BCR-C to one of the members of the Group, it is the responsibility of any data exporter, if needed with the help of the data importer, to assess whether the legislation of the third country of destination does not prevent the recipient from complying with the BCR-C, including with regard to onward transfer situations. This assessment has to be conducted in order to determine whether any legislation or practices of the third country, applicable to the to-be-transferred data go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society to safeguard important public interest objectives, in particular criminal law enforcement and national security and may impinge on the data importer's and/or the data exporter's ability to comply with their commitments taken in the BCR-C, taking into account the circumstances surrounding the transfer. In case of such possible impingement, the data exporter in an EEA Member State, if needed with the help of the data importer, should assess whether it can provide supplementary measures in order to exclude such impingement and therefore to nevertheless ensure, for the envisaged transfer at hand, an essentially equivalent level of protection as provided in the EU. Deploying such supplementary measures is the responsibility of the data exporter and remains its responsibility even after approval of the BCR-C, and as such, they are not assessed by the Supervisory Authorities as part of the approval process of the BCR-C;|Application. Part 1.4
||False|- in any case, where the data exporter is not able to implement supplementary measures necessary to ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection as provided in the EU, personal data cannot be lawfully transferred to a third country under the BCR-C. In the same vein, where the data exporter is made aware of any changes in the relevant third country legislation that undermine the level of data protection required by EU law, the data exporter is required to suspend or end the transfer of personal data at stake to the concerned third countries.   |Application.

Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with the BCR, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the BCR members to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the BCR members have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies."|3.5.4.1

[^15]: References in this paper to GDPR provisions do not imply that GDPR applies directly to the BCR members acting as data importers, but should rather be understood as the threshold for commitments that need to be made in a BCR. If the BCR make reference to GDPR provisions, possible wording to indicate this might e.g. be ""in line with Article X of the GDPR"", ""â€¦ as those provided for by Article X of the GDPR"".
[^16]: Please note that, besides having internal binding nature (i.e. binding effect on the BCR members and their employees), the BCR-C must also have an external binding effect in the sense of providing legal enforceability (of certain parts of the BCR-C) for the data subjects by creating third-party beneficiary rights. See Section 1.3 below as regards this external binding effect.
